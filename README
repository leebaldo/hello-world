College life is so different it makes me feel so free. Now I get to drive our car on my way to school. I come to know new friends. I get to feel welcome by our subject teachers and my very own block mates. Sharing new experiences from different schools and somehow I come to grow learning from their experiences. I think I really like what I’m doing right now, because I am studying for my future. This is very different way back then; during Nursery up to High School we are developing our knowledge, talents, hobbies and a lot more! And now I get to see that what I have learned during those days is very important. Every lesson that we took up was our preparation for college. So I have said that I am a brand new person. I feel great when I keep on answering in class is different now I put more attention and focus on my studies and it feels good, not having the usual mistakes I made in school. I hope that I will have a more improved grades very soon looking forward to become a Dean’s Lister!
There is no perfect, everyone can commit mistakes. One of the student’s sickness during school days is forgetting to do their assigned duties or let’s say their homework’s. But now I come to realize that when a person matures or develop in time and get to know his long term and specific goal they know what they want in life. If we want to be someone lets set our mind to be the best person that we can be. Put an end to your dreams and start working for it.
